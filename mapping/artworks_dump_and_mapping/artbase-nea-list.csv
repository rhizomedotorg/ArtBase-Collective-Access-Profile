The work was created as a contribution to BiennaleOnline 2013, which had been described by organizers ARTPLUS as ""the first exclusively online biennial exhibition of contemporary art."""Legendary Account,Joel Holmberg,2011,1/13/2013,"Legendary Account involves the artist asking profound, existential questions in the user-generated forum Yahoo! Answers, which requires users to select categories like “Pets” or “Home Maintenance” before posting. It is commonly used for questions like “Where is the nearest pet store?” Holmberg’s questions subvert the simple Q&A service. They are too searching, too complex; they tease the system of Yahoo! Answers and challenge commenters to interpret and grapple with philosophical questions."Crystal Gallery,Timur Si-Qin & contributors,2012,11/27/2012,"In 2010 Crystal Gallery's website launched, featuring documentation of a group show titled ""Exhibition One"" curated by Timur Si-Qin and including the work of six contemporary net artists. Crystal Gallery does not exist. Both the gallery space  and the sculptural works displayed within are carefully rendered photorealistic perceptual fabrications. In an age where one's art viewing experience is predominantly experienced through documentation  Si-Qin and his collaborators sought to ask: ""Where does an artwork stop and its documentation begin? What is the function of a prospective image that is decisively not-a-model?"""flo\\/\\/,v5mt,2012,5/28/2012,"This video by Ma≈Çgosia Wo≈∫nica aka v5mt presents a galcieal style of glitch. Rich in colorful flowing video distortions, the visuals unfold slowly in a vertically scanning stream of eerie helenistic imagrey, pop culture, and cryptographic typography, complimented by a subtle soundtrack of droning oscilations."Rocks,Tabor Robak,2012,5/23/2012,"In his 3d composite of imagined stones, Tabor Robak explores symbiotic relationships between man, machine, nature and intent. The 198 stone renderings which are compiled onto one plain, display a tension between man's imagination and the innate capabilities of his tool."Untitled (Standards),Michael Guidetti,2012,5/19/2012,"In Untitled (Standards) Guidetti presents cultural artifacts of  3D modeling and computer graphics. We see the Utah Teapot and other objects that have passed down through generations of computer graphics software as part of a default palate. These are projected onto a watercolor painting of a seemingly virtual light filled gallery space. As the projection unfolds the angle of sunlight and shadows shift in real-time. The objects are, as Guidetti says, ""reverently being preserved in a timeless environment""."All jQuery Effects,Sebastian Schmieg,2012,3/30/2012,"All jQuery Effects, using the settings from the examples, one after another (jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today)."Selected Works ,Christian Oldham,2012,3/22/2012,"The following images are selections of the artist's output between 2010 and 2012.

In far contrast to his early animation work, or his glitch filled datamosh videos, these nine still lives are both cyber-futurist, and retro-nostalgic ‚Äì offering intricately modeled computer rendered scenes depicting objects ranging from the kitch artifact (i.e. VHS cassettes) to the mysterious, futuristic, and fictitious."Homestead Grays,Takeshi Murata,2012,3/9/2012,"This work comes from Murata's early body of work consisting of rich, colorful, psychedelic, hand-drawn animation.

The work juxtaposes a computer generated recitation of Yeat's poem The Song of the Happy Shepherd along side video of scenes captured from the artist's explorations of the virtual environment of Second Life. The simultaneously fantastic and vapid virtual landscapes documented by the artist are at home with Yeat's imagery ""Where are now the warring kings? An idle word is now their glory."""facingface~terrestrialtrancetree,Brenna Murphy,2012,2/25/2012,"This work is but one example of the expansive, layered, complex, multidimensional worlds crafted by Brenna Murphy.

And then the GIF will be the most important file type. The project contains a series of 1024 animated GIFs, each named by a #number. The GIFs show a black line which marks the centre for the 1px large particles rotating around it. #1 is the most unique, it has only 1 pixel flying around, and therefore the most expensive. Down to the end there are so many particles that you can't see the difference between #950 and #1000.
